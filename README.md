# Q-T-Freeze
A script for FiveM that freezes specified players.


Fully customizable through "config.lua"

add `start qtfreeze` in your server.cfg


The ace group is defined as "freeze" you may change this if you want in the "Config.lua". As long as you have `add_ace group.(groupname) freeze (or whatever you change to) "allow" `   in any executed .cfg the permissions will be set.

Example:
`add_ace group.moderator freeze "allow"`
